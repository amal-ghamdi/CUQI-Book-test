    "- We mentioned in the previous [notebook](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQI-Book/chapter03/sampling_with_cuqipy_two_target.html) that the credible interval (CI) visualized here is computed on the KL coefficients and then mapped to the function values (through computing the linear combination of the KL basis weighted by the KL coefficients and applying the map $x \\rightarrow e^x $). We are interested in mapping all the samples to the function values and then computing the credible interval. To achieve this in CUQIpy, one can use the property `funvals` of the `Samples` object. This property returns the function values of the samples wrapped in another `Samples` object. Use this property to create the `Samples` objects of function values `MH_samples_funvals` and `CWMH_samples_funvals` and then compute the credible interval on these new `Samples` object. Do this for both cases, the `MH` and the `CWMH` cases. Which sampler resulted in samples with a better credible interval?\n",

    "- Which approach of visualizing the credible interval do you prefer (mapping then computing the CI or the other way around)? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the credible interval for both cases in the coefficient space. To achieve this in CUQIpy, pass the argument `plot_par=True` to the `plot_ci` method. What do you notice? what do you observe about the credible intervals in the coefficient space as the coefficient index increases? Hint: use the original `MH_samples` and `CWMH_samples` objects and not the ones converted to function values. Which sampler performs better in the coefficient space?\n",

    "\n",
    "- Plot the sampler scale for both cases in the same plot (the $x-\\text{axis}$ is the sample index and the $y-\\text{axis}$ is the scale). What do you notice? Hint: you can use `CWMH_sampler.scale` and `MH_sampler.scale` to get the scale for each sampler. Keep in mind that the scale for the `MH` sampler is the same for all components."

    "We see that although the number of `NUTS` samples is much smaller than in the `CWMH` samples, the ESS is much larger. This however comes at a cost of computational time, which is due to building the tree structure in each iteration as well as the finite difference approximation of the gradient. Note that other approaches that are more computationally efficient can be used to compute the gradient of the target distribution, e.g. computing the adjoint-based gradient."
