    "\n",
    "This notebooks describes basic usage of distributions including visualizing their PDF/CDF and generating samples. Then conditional distributions are demonstrated along with the creation of user-defined distributions. Finally, the notebook describes how distributions can be equipped with geometry to represent sampling in nontrivial spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives of this notebook:\n",
    "- Set up random variables following uni- and multivariate distributions in CUQIpy.\n",
    "- Generate samples from distributions and use CUQIpy tools to inspect visually.\n",
    "- Set up conditional distributions in CUQIpy - simple and using lambda functions.\n",
    "- ★ Create a user-defined distribution from a logpdf function.\n",
    "- ★ Explain the use of Geometry in distributions and samples.\n",
