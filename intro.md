# Welcome to the "Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems with CUQIpy" mini-book!

**Note: this mini-book is under construction**

This mini-book contains training material on how to use the [CUQIpy](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQIpy) library for uncertainty quantification in inverse problems. It also covers some of the theoretical background behind the methods implemented in CUQIpy.
