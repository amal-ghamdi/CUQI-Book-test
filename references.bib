journal = {Inverse Problems},
abstract = {This paper introduces CUQIpy, a versatile open-source Python package for computational uncertainty quantification (UQ) in inverse problems, presented as Part I of a two-part series. CUQIpy employs a Bayesian framework, integrating prior knowledge with observed data to produce posterior probability distributions that characterize the uncertainty in computed solutions to inverse problems. The package offers a high-level modeling framework with concise syntax, allowing users to easily specify their inverse problems, prior information, and statistical assumptions. CUQIpy supports a range of efficient sampling strategies and is designed to handle large-scale problems. Notably, the automatic sampler selection feature analyzes the problem structure and chooses a suitable sampler without user intervention, streamlining the process. With a selection of probability distributions, test problems, computational methods, and visualization tools, CUQIpy serves as a powerful, flexible, and adaptable tool for UQ in a wide selection of inverse problems. Part II of the series focuses on the use of CUQIpy for UQ in inverse problems with partial differential equations.}

title = {CUQIpy: II. Computational uncertainty quantification for PDE-based inverse problems in Python},
journal = {Inverse Problems},
abstract = {Inverse problems, particularly those governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), are prevalent in various scientific and engineering applications, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) of solutions to these problems is essential for informed decision-making. This second part of a two-paper series builds upon the foundation set by the first part, which introduced CUQIpy, a Python software package for computational UQ in inverse problems using a Bayesian framework. In this paper, we extend CUQIpy’s capabilities to solve PDE-based Bayesian inverse problems through a general framework that allows the integration of PDEs in CUQIpy, whether expressed natively or using third-party libraries such as FEniCS. CUQIpy offers concise syntax that closely matches mathematical expressions, streamlining the modeling process and enhancing the user experience. The versatility and applicability of CUQIpy to PDE-based Bayesian inverse problems are demonstrated on examples covering parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs. This includes problems involving the heat and Poisson equations and application case studies in electrical impedance tomography and photo-acoustic tomography, showcasing the software’s efficiency, consistency, and intuitive interface. This comprehensive approach to UQ in PDE-based inverse problems provides accessibility for non-experts and advanced features for experts.}
