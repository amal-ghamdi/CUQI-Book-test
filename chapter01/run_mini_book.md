# Running the mini-book code examples


Here we suggest the following options to run the code and solve the coding exercises in this mini-book:
    - Running on your local machine (preferred)
    - Running the notebook interactively 

#### Option 1: Running on your local machine
- You can download each notebook from the top right download button and run it on your local machine.
- Alternatively, you can clone the course repository and run the notebooks on your local machine. In a terminal, run the following command inside the directory where you want to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CUQI-DTU/CUQI-Book.git
```
- To run the notebook, you will need to install CUQIpy and other dependencies, including Jupyter notebook, numpy, matplotlib, etc.

- The instructions for installing CUQIpy can be found [here](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/user/getting_started.html).

#### Option 2: Running the notebook interactively
- You can run the notebook interactively using the Binder service or Google Colab. On the top right corner of the notebook, you will find a "rocket" icon that will take you to the Binder service or Google Colab. 
- Note that the Binder service may take a few minutes to load the notebook.
- Note that on google colab, you may need to install CUQIpy by running the following command in a cell:
```python
!pip install cuqipy
```
