**Note: some of the details mentioned here will make more sense after going through the [next notebook](intro_example_short.ipynb) that demonstrates how to use CUQIpy to solve a simple Bayesian inverse problem.**

## What is CUQIpy? <a class="anchor" id="r-what-is-cuqipy"></a>
* CUQIpy is a Python package.
* CUQIpy stands for **C**omputational **U**ncertainty **Q**uantification for **I**nverse **P**roblems in **Py**thon.
* CUQIpy provides a framework for solving inverse problems using Bayesian inference.
* The framework enables:
  * Modeling Bayesian inverse problems
  * Solving Bayesian inverse problems using classical and advanced numerical tools
  * Analyzing the solution of Bayesian inverse problems

## Why CUQIpy? <a class="anchor" id="r-why-cuqipy"></a>
CUQIpy is built to address the need for:
  - A unified framework for solving Bayesian inverse problems across various scientific and engineering applications
  - A platform for modeling, solving and analyzing the solution of Bayesian inverse problems
  - A tool that can be used for both research and teaching
  - A tool that can be used by both beginners and advanced users
  - A tool that combines classical and advanced and scalable numerical methods for solving Bayesian inverse problems
  - A tool that is implemented purely in Python with minimal dependencies and can be easily maintained and integrated with other tools


## CUQIpy modules <a class="anchor" id="r-cuqipy-modules"></a>
* CUQIpy consists of many modules for modeling, solving, and analyzing Bayesian inverse problems.
* These modules mostly correspond to typical components/tools needed for modeling and solving Bayesian inverse problems.
* Each module contains classes and functions that are used to perform specific tasks.
* click [here](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/api/index.html) for an overview of the modules available in CUQIpy.

## CUQIpy plugins <a class="anchor" id="r-cuqipy-plugins"></a>

* In addition to the CUQIpy modules, CUQIpy also has plugins that extend the functionality of the framework. 
* These plugins allow integration of third-party software and tools with CUQIpy.
* click [here](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/#cuqipy-plugins) to see the list of plugins available in CUQIpy.

## CUQIpy design principles <a class="anchor" id="r-cuqipy-design-principles"></a>
* Provide simple and intuitive interface for users
* Design for flexibility, extensibility, modularity, and maintainability
* Accommodate both beginners and advanced users. e.g.,
  - Provide a set of test problems to use for experimentation and prototyping
  - Automatic sampler selection for a range of problems
  - Enable advanced customization of the problem setup and solution
* Aligning the modeling code with the mathematical formulation of the problem, e.g.,
 
Bayesian model:

$$
\begin{align*}
d &\sim \text{Gamma}(1, 10^{-4})\\
s &\sim \text{Gamma}(1, 10^{-4})\\
x &\sim \text{LMRF}(\mathbf{0}, d^{-1})\\
y &\sim \text{Gaussian}(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}, s^{-1}\mathbf{I})\\
p(d,s,x,y) &= p(d)p(s)p(x|d)p(y|x,s)
\end{align*}
$$

where $d^{-1}$ and $s$ are the precision parameters of the prior (the LMRF) and the data distribution (the Gaussian), respectively, $x$ is the unknown parameter, and $y$ is the data. $\mathbf{A}$ is the forward operator.

Bayesian model in CUQIpy:
```python
d = Gamma(1, 1e-4)
s = Gamma(1, 1e-4)
x = LMRF(0, lambda d: 1/d)
y = Gaussian(A@x, lambda s: 1/s)
joint = JointDistribution(d, s, x, y)
```
