# Chapter 1: Introduction to CUQIpy

In this chapter, we introduce the CUQIpy package and its main features. We provide information on how to run the code notebooks in this book. We also provide a very simple example of solving a Bayesian inverse problem (BIP) using CUQIpy: "Probably the simplest BIP in the world". This example is presented in two versions: A short version which is right to the point and a long version which explains more details about the code and gives some exercises.
