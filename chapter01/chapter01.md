# Chapter 1: Introduction to Bayesian Inverse Problems (BIP) in CUQIpy

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Explain what is CUQIpy and list its main features and modules
- Install CUQIpy
- Create, solve and analyze 2D Bayesian inverse problem (BIP) using CUQIpy
- Explain the difference between data distribution and likelihood
- Explain the role of prior and likelihood
- List 2 methods used to characterize the posterior distribution
- Create (or load pre-existing) linear and non-linear forward models in CUQIpy and use them.
- Mathematically define two forward models: 1D Poisson and 1D Convolution and use them in CUQIpy
